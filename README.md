📘 React Timer Counter (Increment / Decrement)

This is a simple React project where you can increase, decrease, start timer, stop timer, and reset a counter.
It is made using React Hooks (useState, useEffect).

🚀 Features
✔ Increment

Increases the counter by +1 when you click the button.

✔ Decrement

Decreases the counter by –1 when you click the button.
You can also add logic so the counter does not go below 0.

✔ Auto Timer

When you press Start, the counter increases automatically every 1 second.
Press Stop to stop the timer.

✔ Reset

This sets the counter back to 0 and also stops the timer.

✔ Uses React Hooks

useState → stores counter value

useEffect → runs the timer logic
